## Description
This application is a part of the AMLS project (Autonomous Multi-rotor Landing System).
The task of the project is to automatically land a drone on a platform in motion.

![Screenshot](https://github.com/XxOinvizioNxX/Liberty-Way/blob/main/git_images/main_preview.png "Screenshot")

This application processes the frame received from the camera located on the platform which is looking up. On the bottom of the drone, there is an ARUco tag. The application detects the marker, estimates its position, then passes through the PID controller and sends the correction values to the drone.

## Logotype
AMLS and Liberty-X logo was designed by Pavel Neshumov

-----------

## Building and running
Liberty-Way is a cross-platform application and has been tested on Linux and Windows. 
You can try running the application on any other operating system. But you first need to build the OpenCV-contrib library (**The releases include libraries for Windows and Linux**).
Builded binary JAR-file can be found in releases.


All of the controls is performed only from the browser.
When starting the application, you can specify the arguments:
```
 -c,--color                write colored logs.
 -i,--ip <arg>             server ip
 -sp,--server_port <arg>   web server port (0 - 65535)
 -vp,--video_port <arg>    video stream port (0 - 65535)
```
Also, the server address and ports can be specified in the configuration (settings.json)

## Data packet structure
This is the structure of a packet that is being sent to the drone for execution of a PID controller arguments:

![Packet](https://github.com/XxOinvizioNxX/Liberty-Way/blob/main/git_images/data_structure.png "Data packet")

Bytes description:
- **Roll bytes** - Roll correction values 
- **Pitch bytes** - Pitch correction values 
- **Yaw bytes** - Yaw correction values
- **Altitude bytes** - Altitude correction values
- **Service info** - Sets the drone state. After beta_3.0.0: 0 - IDLE, 1 - Direct control, 2 - Pressure (altitude) setpoint, 3 - GPS setpoint, 4 - Turn off the motors, 5 - Start Liberty Way sequence, 6 - Abort Liberty Way sequence. 
- **Service info** - Before beta_3.0.0: 0 - Nothing to do, 1 - Stabilization, 2 - Landing (command not implemented and will be removed in the future. This is not a real landing, just to tell the drone to start decreasing altitude), 3 - Disable motors
- **Check byte** - XOR sum of all previous bytes that is compared via transmittion in order to verify the data
- **Data suffix** - unique pair of ASCII symbols that is not represented in the packet in any form and that shows the end of the packet
