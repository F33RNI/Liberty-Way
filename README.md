### Description
This application is a part of the AMLS project (Autonomous Multi-rotor Landing System).
The task of the project is to automatically land a drone on a platform in motion.

This application processes the frame received from the camera located on the platform which is looking up. On the bottom of the drone, there is an ARUco tag. The application detects the marker, estimates its position, then passes through the PID controller and sends the correction values to the drone.

------------

### Building and running
Liberty Way is a cross-platform application and has been tested on Linux and Windows. 
You can try running the application on any other operating system. But you first need to build the OpenCV-contrib library (**The releases include libraries for Windows and Linux**).
Builded binary JAR-file can be found in releases as well as in the main branch (Liberty-Way.jar file)


All of the controls is performed only from the browser.
When starting the application, you can specify the arguments:
```
 -c,--color                write colored logs.
 -i,--ip <arg>             server ip
 -sp,--server_port <arg>   web server port (0 - 65535)
 -vp,--video_port <arg>    video stream port (0 - 65535)
```
Also, the server address and ports can be specified in the configuration (settings.json)
