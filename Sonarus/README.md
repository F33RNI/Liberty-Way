----------

Sonarus is a system consisting of two HC-SR04 ultrasonic rangefinders connected to an Atmega328 microcontroller (Arduino).
The purpose of the system is to provide the ability to measure distance from two sensors via the I2C bus.

Currently, Sonarus is used on the Liberty-X drone in order to avoid collisions with obstacles, as well as to prevent accidental motors shutdown during landing.
The first sensor is in front of the drone and looks forward, the second is at the bottom of the drone and looks below.
