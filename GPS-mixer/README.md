GPS Mixer uses several low-cost GPS receivers (Ublox NEO-M8n) to improve the accuracy and reliability of GPS coordinates. Up to 3 receivers are currently in use.

GPS Mixer takes data from available receivers and calculates the arithmetic mean of the coordinates. Also, this solution will allow the drone to continue flying in the event of a loss of 1-2 receivers. In case of loss / appearance of receivers, there is a function to compensate for coordinate jumps.
